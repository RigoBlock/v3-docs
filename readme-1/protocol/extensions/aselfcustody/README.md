# ASelfCustody

Pools holding a minimum of 100K GRG in active stake may transfer tokens to a wallet of their choice. White this feature may be seen as a weakness, the required GRG amount is big enough to limit the use to the biggest pools only. This enables pools to operate on applications that have not yet been integrated with RigoBlock or even using deep cold storage.

This feature will likely be removed in the future, as more applications/protocols are connected to RigoBlock.
